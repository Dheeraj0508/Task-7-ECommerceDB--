SQL TASK 7 — INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

1. What is a view?
A view is a virtual table created from a SQL SELECT query. It doesn’t store data itself but displays data from one or more tables.

2. Can we update data through a view?
Yes, if the view is based on a single table and doesn’t include GROUP BY, DISTINCT, or aggregate functions. Otherwise, updates may be restricted.

3. What is a materialized view?
A materialized view stores the result of a query physically like a table. It can be refreshed periodically and improves performance for complex queries.

4. Difference between view and table?
A table stores actual data in the database. A view is a saved query that displays data from tables but doesn’t store it.

5. How to drop a view?
Use the command: DROP VIEW view_name;

6. Why use views?
Views simplify complex queries, improve readability, provide abstraction, and help restrict access to sensitive data.

7. Can we create indexed views?
Yes, in some databases like SQL Server. Indexed views store data physically and improve performance but have strict creation rules.

8. How to secure data using views?
By creating views that expose only specific columns or rows, you can control what users see without giving access to full tables.

9. What are limitations of views?
Views can’t always be updated, especially if they include joins, aggregates, or complex logic. Performance may be slower than direct table access.

10. How does WITH CHECK OPTION work?
WITH CHECK OPTION ensures that data inserted or updated through a view meets the view’s WHERE condition. It prevents changes that would make rows invisible to the view.
